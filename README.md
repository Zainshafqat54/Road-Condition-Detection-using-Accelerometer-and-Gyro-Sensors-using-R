## Introduction
This project aims to detect road conditions using accelerometer and gyro sensors. The goal is to answer the following questions:

1. Does using the accelerometer sensor in combination with the gyro sensor provide a better chance of detecting road conditions?
2. Which accelerometer readings are most effective in explaining road conditions?
3. Is there evidence to support the claim that road conditions are mostly bad at high speeds?
4. Is there a correlation between the time of recording and road condition?
5. Which 5 sensor values provide the best prediction of road conditions?

## Data
The data used in this project consists of readings from both accelerometer and gyro sensors.

## Methodology
Hypothesis testing and experimental methods will be used to answer the questions posed above. The results of the experiments and all intermediate steps, graphs, and findings will be included in the analysis.

## Conclusion
The results of this project will provide insight into the effectiveness of using accelerometer and gyro sensors for road condition detection. The findings will also inform future work in this area by highlighting the most effective sensor readings and any correlations between recording time and road condition.
